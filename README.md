# A Sight Never Seen
"A Sight Never Seen" is a first-person POV, immersive narrative game.

In this world, there are humans and magicians, however, magicians are rare and often hide their powers because of a series of unexplained accidents that cause humans to put the blame on them. Lyra and Leo are magicians that live in Veritas, a town known for their trading businesses. Ewan, who is their childhood friend, has just recently moved back to the town of Veritas. While Lyra and Leo are showing Ewan around different locations in the town, they encounter an incident that causes them to expose their magic to another character. The character that the player will meet depends on the location, in which the player will choose.

In "A Sight Never Seen", the player is able to develop their relationship with the selected character through different interactions. Based on the choices the player makes, it could lead to either a bad ending or a good ending.
